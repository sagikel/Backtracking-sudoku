I discussed the exercise with: None.

==================
=  Description:  =
==================

In this exercise, we practice recursion and backtracking.

==========================
=  Auxiliary functions:  =
==========================

#  *** PART 1 ***  #

1. where_is_zero:
    The purpose is to find and colette all of the zero cells in the sudoku.
2. squares_to_list:
    The purpose is to make a list of lists of all the cells that in single
    square - for the square_check.
3. solve_sudoku_helper:
    The function doing the recursion and the backtracking.
4. square_check:
    The purpose is to check if a possible number can be in a square.

#  *** PART 2 ***  #

1. ******.helper:
    All functions that have this extension perform the recursion and the
